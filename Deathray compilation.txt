Deathray compilation
====================

The project was created with Visual Studio 2008 and updated with VS2012
Express Edition.

Ensure that the OpenCL SDK paths match the location of the SDK on your system.
 
The AMD APP SDK 2.8 was used to make the project. Environment variables based 
on that SDK are in the project's properties. These should ensure that paths 
match on your system if you are using the AMD APP SDK.

For other SDKs you will need to supply the appropriate paths in:

C++ 
---

Additional Include Directories, option /I


Linker
------

Additional Library Directories, option /LIBPATH
Additional Dependencies

If in doubt examine these settings from a sample project that was installed
as part of the SDK that you are using.


Note on Compilation of OpenCL Kernels
=====================================

The text of the OpenCL kernels is found in project files whose extension is
.CL. These files are "compiled" by Visual Studio into the DLL as resources.

Any changes to the code in these source files requires that Visual Studio
re-compiles the resources. This consists of right-clicking on Deathray.rc
and choosing the option "Compile".

The resources then need to be linked into the DLL, so link Deathray.


Note on OpenCL Debugging
========================

It is easiest to use AMD's APP Kernel Analyzer2 to check for compilation
errors in OpenCL code. Copy all the code from the following files, in this 
order, into Kernel Analyzer's Source Code pane:

 - Util.cl 
 - nlm.cl
 - SingleFrameNLM.cl
 - MultiFrameNLM.cl
